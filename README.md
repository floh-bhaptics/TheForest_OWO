# TheForest_OWO
First simple OWO mod for The Forest VR. If you have questions or issues, ping me in the OWO Discord.

## Installation
1. Get the [MelonLoader installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation) and install MelonLoader on your game executable.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/TheForest_OWO/releases/latest/) of the mod and unzip the contents into the "Mods" directory in your game folder.
3. That's it. Start your OWO app in the same network, connect to the OWO skin, and start up the game.

## Featured effects
- Hacking with your tool
- Collisions
- Fall damage
- Freeze/choking/burning damage
- shooting
- rain, diving, ...
- ...

## Customization
You can adjust the OWO sensations of each effect yourself. In the "Mods" directory, you will find an "OWO" folder. It contains all the used sensations in this mod, and you can open, edit, and overwrite them using the OWO Sensation Creator. Note that the muscle(s) used in the sensations named "Impact.owo" and "Raindrop.owo" will be ignored and the stored effect will be played back on the muscle area that is actually colliding in the game, or in the case of rain, randomly.
